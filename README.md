##Base HTML Site Framework

This repo serves as the base framework for all FED deliverables and temp sites. This gives us a good base set of styles, resets, and a solid structure for building simple to complex projects quickly.

Keep this repo on the bleeding edge of what is out there and then update project as needed.

### Components
- SASS
- Normalize.css
- JQuery 3.1.x

### SCSS Layout
---

#### Folder Structure:

- **Modules** - This folder holds all the variables and functions used in the scss files, but do not actually render as css.

- **Pages** - Add new scss files in this folder for each page or section of the site. This keeps things in the context of the page or section they live in.

- **Partials** - Add all partials for includes, global elements or other elements in this folder.
